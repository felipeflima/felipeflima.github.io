    <p>The <b>hyacinth macaw</b> (<i>Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus</i>), or <b>hyacinthine macaw</b>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot" title="Parrot">parrot</a> native to central and eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaw" title="Macaw">macaw</a> and the largest flying parrot species; the flightless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81p%C5%8D" title="Kākāpō">kākāpō</a> of New Zealand outweighs it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lear%27s_macaw" title="Lear's macaw">Lear's macaw</a>. Habitat loss and the trapping of wild birds for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, so the species is classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species">Vulnerable</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List">Red List</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-IUCN_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IUCN-1">[1]</a></sup> and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" class="mw-redirect" title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES).</p>

    <p>English physician, ornithologist, and artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Latham_(ornithologist)" title="John Latham (ornithologist)">John Latham</a> first described the hyacinth macaw in 1790 under the binomial name <i>Psittacus hyacinthinus</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Latham1790_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw#cite_note-Latham1790-3">[3]</a></sup> Tony Pittman in 2000 hypothesized that although the illustration in this work appears to be of an actual hyacinthine macaw, Latham's description of the length of the bird might mean he had measured a specimen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lear%27s_macaw" title="Lear's macaw">Lear's macaw</a> instead. However, Latham's description was based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw#Taxonomy" class="mw-redirect" title="Taxidermic">taxidermic</a> specimen, which was the only one Latham knew to exist up until 1822. It was prepared from a living animal originally belonging to Lord Orford, and given to the land agent Parkinson for display in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverian_collection" title="Leverian collection">Leverian Museum</a> after it died.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, Latham mentions another bird, which he calls the 'blue maccaw', supposedly the same size. This blue macaw was already described in Latham's 1781 volume of his A general synopsis of birds as merely a variety of the blue and yellow macaw, and was previously figured in the work of Mathurin Jacques Brisson (1760), Patrick Browne (1756) and Eleazar Albin (1738) as a macaw found in Jamaica. Albin, Browne and Brisson all reference even older authors and state the bird also occurs on the mainland, and Albin states this bird is the female version of the scarlet macaw. Latham mentions that the provenance of parrots in general was often confused by the fact that the birds were much traded across the world for the purposes of sale.</p>
    <p> It is one of two extant and one probably extinct species of the South American macaw genus Anodorhynchus.</p>

    <p>The largest parrot by length in the world, the hyacinth macaw is 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long from the tip of its tail to the top of its head and weighs 1.2–1.7 kg (2 lb 10 oz–3 lb 12 oz). Each wing is 38.8–42.5 cm (15+1⁄4–16+3⁄4 in) long. The tail is long and pointed. Its feathers are entirely blue, lighter above. However, the neck feathers can sometimes be slightly grey. The ring around the parrots eyes and area just underneath the beak are a strong, vibrant yellow.</p>

    <p>The majority of the hyacinth macaw diet is composed of the nuts from specific palm species, such as acuri and bocaiuva palms. They have very strong beaks for eating the kernels of hard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a> and seeds. Their strong beaks are even able to crack coconuts, the large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_nut" title="Brazil nut">brazil nut</a> pods, and macadamia nuts. The birds also boast dry, smooth tongues with a bone inside them that makes them an effective tool for tapping into fruits. The acuri nut is so hard, the parrots cannot feed on it until it has passed through the digestive system of cattle. In addition, they eat and other vegetable matter. The hyacinth macaw generally eats fruits, nuts, nectar, and various kinds of seeds. Also, they travel for the ripest of foods over a vast area.</p>
